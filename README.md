Building a File Upload Website — A Journey in Data Engineering
At first glance, a website to upload flat files may seem like a simple project. However, for many data engineering students, it can be challenging to find complete end-to-end projects that showcase how different technologies are interconnected. In this post, I’ll take you through the journey I took to build such a website, which can serve as a helpful quick start for understanding how these technologies work together.

My goal with this project is to provide insight into how different technologies can be integrated to create a complete solution. While I plan to delve into the specificities and best practices of each aspect of the project later, for now, I will focus on the high-level solution.

Although this project is still a work in progress and has room for improvement, I consider it a live project. I plan to implement new ideas and technologies and write about my learning experiences in future posts.

For those concerned about cloud costs, I can assure you that the cost of this project was less than 5 dollars.

Why a File Upload Website?
Ok, we usually focus on cool tools to work with data engineering but imagine, some of you won´t have much trouble with that, that you have an Excel file where the business team keeps track of hundreds of rows that must be often manually updated in a CRM.

With that said, how could we develop a solution that would enable the business team to mass upload their updates that later on would be processed by the data engineering team to the CRM? The solution also must be hefty enough to keep track of the submissions, check data column schema before moving the file to the processing stage, and also be scalable and cost-effective.
